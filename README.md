This Notebook uses unsupervised machine learning methods to test two fairly widespread beliefs about the schools in, the capital of Norway, Oslo.

* The first belief is that schools located at traditionally richer the west side of Oslo provides a better education than schools on the east side.
* The second belief is that schools located in more immigrant dense areas of Oslo provides a relatively better environment for learning Math, Natural Sciences and English than Norwegian.

To test whether these beliefs are true, this notebook will make use of a publicly available dataset that comprises the final assessment grades received by the students at different secondary schools in Oslo (10th grade in Norway). The dataset covers six subjects: English, Mathematics, Natural Science, Norwegian oral, Norwegian primary language written and Norwegian secondary language written. The dataset can be downloaded by following this link: <a href="https://www.udir.no/tall-og-forskning/statistikk/statistikk-grunnskole/grunnskolekarakterer/?rapportsideKode=GSK_GSKarakterer&filtre=EierformID(-10)_EnhetID(-76_-17_-12)_FagID(31650_31663_31668_31670_31671_31672)_KaraktertypeID(1)_KjoennID(-10)_TidID(202206)_VisAntallPersoner(0)_VisKarakterfordeling(0)&radsti=F">link</a>. 

The analysis will be carried out using two types of clustering algorithms: kMeans and Hierarchical clustering.
